PHPActiveRecord Spark
====================

[PHPActiveRecord](http://www.phpactiverecord.org/) is an open source ORM library,
largely based on [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.com)' ActiveRecord.

This spark is used to easily integrate PHPActiveRecord into CodeIgniter 2.0+.

**NOTE:** PHPActiveRecord requires PHP5.3+, logging requires the PEAR Log library.

Installation
------------

### Sparks Manager

Navigate to the root of your CodeIgniter project and run

    php tools/spark install php-activerecord

### Manually 

* Navigate to your CodeIgniter project's 'sparks' folder
* Extract the php-activerecord spark here, ensure it is named 'php-activerecord'

Configuration
------------

PHPActiveRecord will use the config/database.php file to determine your
database settings.  It is capable of handling several connections, but will
default to your `$active_group` connection.  You may change the connection any
model uses within the model itself.

PHPActiveRecord does not require you to define your database tables before use,
simply extend your model from the `ActiveRecord\Model` class and your model
will be ready for use (aside from any extra configuration you may want to add
later).

Documentation
------------

Examples, documentation, and help forums are available at
http://phpactiverecord.org.

Verify PHPActiveRecord Works
---------------------------

Create a table in your database named `tests` and give it some test
information, perhaps an id and a varchar column.  Create at least one or two
records.

Create a new file in your models directory named 'Test.php'

Give model the following content:

    <?php

    class Test extends ActiveRecord\Model { }


Proceed to 'welcome.php' within your controllers directory

Within the index function, enter the following prior to the view being called

    $this->load->spark('php-activerecord/0.0.2');
    echo '<pre>'; var_dump(Test::all()); exit;

If you've followed the steps above, you should now see a print out of your
object, with the class of your Model.  Success!  PHPActiveRecord is now ready
for use!

Logging and Profiling
---------------------

If you'd like to enable logging and profiling, simply uncomment the
designated block from `./libraries/PHPActiveRecord.php` beginning at
line 59.

HMVC Support
------------

If you use the Module Extensions HMVC, the model folders in each module
will automatically be checked for models just as the regular model
folder would.
